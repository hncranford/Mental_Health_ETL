# Mental Health ETL
Found multiple CSV files on Mental Health and Sucide Rates by Country. These were all cleaned and used to create a final DataBase. 

To begin, we uploaded and cleaned the Data in order to show what Sucide Rates are and how accessible Mental Health care is in a given country. To narrow down the database, We chose to review only Croatia. 

In order to create our final database we cleaned up our data using Pandas and then exported this file to SQL to create our final table of Croatia's Sucide Rates vs options for help in the Mental Health Sector.
